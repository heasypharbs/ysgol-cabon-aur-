                    <p class="text-justify">Ysgol Caban Aur is a small (registered for 4 pupils aged 11-16 years), independent, specialist school, that is within the organisation of Afon Goch Children’s Home Ltd (AGCH). This organisation provides residential care with a therapeutic practice.
                                            Learners who attend YCA have usually faced considerable barriers to learning, for diverse reasons, and have often experienced challenges in their lives that are greater than those of many of their peers. YCA’s curriculum is composed of broad opportunities to successfully engage in learning. YCA works in close collaboration with the Afon Goch Children’s Home ethos of; ‘Relieve pain, restore hope and bring beauty to the world’. The therapeutic focus on each resident’s care, by AGCH, is also intrinsically linked and integral to the school’s practice. </p>

                    <p class="text-justify">YCA takes a strong position against bullying. Each learner is supervised at all times, so that instances of any type of bullying can be addressed immediately. </p>

                    <p class="text-justify">YCA will issue a ‘consequence’ to a learner, if an action is considered to have negatively impacted on other learners or staff. This a written document that is given to the learner and the house manager, detailing the reason for the consequence and the nature of the consequence. All consequences are monitored by house managers, the headteacher and during a monthly, external inspection.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify">If a learner’s actions require more significant recourse, then a temporary exclusion could be enforced. </p>

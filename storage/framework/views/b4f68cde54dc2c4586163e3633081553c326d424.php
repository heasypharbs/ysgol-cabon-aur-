                    <p class="text-justify">Ysgol Caban Aur (YCA) is an integral part of Afon Goch Children’s Homes Ltd (AGCH).  YCA is a registered independent school, for up to four learners.  Learners can enrol at whatever point of their education, within key stage 3 and key stage 4; ages 11 – 16 years. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">
                         YCA is based at AGCH’s second home; Caban Aur. Caban Aur is set in its own grounds: in a rural setting, surrounded by a nature reserve. Anglesey and nearby Snowdonia are well endowed with learning opportunities: both from the natural environment and from the very large and varied selection of sites of interest; historical, cultural, outdoor activities and recreational.
